# Datasets-for-instruments-registration

This dataset aims to achieve the point cloud registration on real scenes, which includes the intraoperative surgical scenes (Scene folder) and the segmented instruments (Segmentation results folder). They are all .ply files.

The intraoperative surgical scenes are reconstructed according to the paper "Recovering dense 3D point clouds from single endoscopic image"; and the data can be found at https://github.com/LONG-XI/Endoscopic-3D-Point-Clouds-Datasets.
